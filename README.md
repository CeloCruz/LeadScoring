Take a look at the project: https://nbviewer.org/github/CeloCruz/LeadScoring/blob/main/Lead_Scoring_Final.ipynb

## Project Overview
**Objective:** 
Develop an efficient lead scoring model for X Education to identify potential leads with high conversion chances.

**Description:** 
The core objective of this project was to surpass an 80% conversion rate for X Education. We embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, constructing and optimizing classification models. Model performance was thoroughly assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves, with the project achieving an impressive conversion rate of almost 95%. Importantly, this project emphasized the transformation of data into relevant insights, presented in the form of graphs and valuable business suggestions. It was structured with meticulous attention, focusing on the creation of sustainable pipelines for all data preprocessing steps, ensuring the efficiency and repeatability of the lead scoring process for X Education.
