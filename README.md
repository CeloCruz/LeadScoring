# Lead Scoring: From Business Understanding to ML modeling with pandas and Scikit-Learn!

Take a look at the project: https://nbviewer.org/github/CeloCruz/LeadScoring/blob/main/Lead_Scoring_Final.ipynb

## Project Overview
**Objective:** To build an efficient lead scoring model for X Education that identifies potential leads with higher conversion chances.

**Description:** Lead scoring plays a critical role in optimizing lead conversion rates. In this project, we focus on developing a robust lead-scoring model tailored for X Education. The key aspects of this project are as follows:

**Data Exploration:** We embark on a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, gaining insights into customer attributes and the distribution of lead conversions and non-conversions.

**Model Building:** Multiple classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, are constructed to predict lead conversions. Each model undergoes hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

**Model Evaluation:** The performance of these models is rigorously assessed using a validation test to ensure their effectiveness in predicting lead conversions on unseen data.

**Comparison:** An evaluation test is conducted on a separate dataset to compare the model performances. Remarkably, the gradient boosting model emerges as the top performer, exhibiting superior precision and F1-score in both tests.
