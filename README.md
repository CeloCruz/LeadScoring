# Lead Scoring: From Business Understanding to ML modeling with pandas and Scikit-Learn!

Project Overview
Project Name: Lead Scoring for X Education

Objective: To build an efficient lead scoring model for X Education that identifies potential leads with higher conversion chances.

Description: Lead scoring plays a critical role in optimizing lead conversion rates. In this project, we focus on developing a robust lead scoring model tailored for X Education. The key aspects of this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: We embark on a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, gaining insights into customer attributes and the distribution of lead conversions and non-conversions.

Model Building: Multiple classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, are constructed to predict lead conversions. Each model undergoes hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

Model Evaluation: The performance of these models is rigorously assessed using a validation test to ensure their effectiveness in predicting lead conversions on unseen data.

Comparison: An evaluation test is conducted on a separate dataset to compare the model performances. Remarkably, the gradient boosting model emerges as the top performer, exhibiting superior precision and F1-score in both tests.
